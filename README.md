# csgoawoo
csgo awoo language
I don't know why I spent the time making this or why you care enought to read my README.

If you actually want to use this for some ungodly reason, here is how its done:
-download csgo_awoo.txt
-put it in steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource
-open Steam and right click on CSGO in your library and click properties
-paste "-language awoo" in the launch options
-launch the game
